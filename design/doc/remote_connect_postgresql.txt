Remote access to the PostgreSQL server

 - Modify /etc/postgresql/9.6/main/postgresql.conf: add the following line:
	listen_addresses = '*'
	
	This makes postgresql to listen on all ip addresses.
	
 - Modify /etc/postgresql/9.6/main/pg_hba.conf: add the following line as the first file of the file:
	host	all		all		0.0.0.0/0	md5

	This makes postgresql to accept all user's connection.
	
 - Restart postgresql after the modifications:

	 sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql restart
